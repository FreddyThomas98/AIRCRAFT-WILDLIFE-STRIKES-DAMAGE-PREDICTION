# In the realm of aviation safety, the menace of wildlife strikes looms large, presenting a formidable challenge to aircraft integrity and passenger security. Our project delves into the depths of the FAA Wildlife Strike Database, spanning over three decades of incident records from 1990 to 2023. Through meticulous analysis, we unravel the intricate web of factors contributing to aircraft damage induced by wildlife encounters.

# With a keen focus on crucial variables such as aircraft types, wildlife species involved, and incident locations, our endeavor aims to shed light on the underlying dynamics of these events. By harnessing the wealth of data at our disposal, we pave the way for informed decision-making and targeted preventive measures to fortify aviation safety protocols.

# Our comprehensive understanding of wildlife strike patterns serves as the cornerstone for the development and implementation of strategic interventions, mitigating risks and bolstering safety measures within the aviation industry. Through data-driven insights, we navigate the complex terrain of airplane-wildlife interactions, striving towards a future where such incidents are minimized, and skies remain safer for all.
